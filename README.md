# JCDB
JCDB is a windows desktop application to upload, search, sort and download research papers (Journals and Conferences) as well as student papers. This application provides a simple interface to access and upload your papers. Several filters such as title, affiliation, indexing, issue, volume, year of publication etc. can be used to pin point and access exactly which paper you want. This application can also be used to create an excel or pdf file which contains the list og papers and their details. A list is prepared depending on the attributes the user has chosen to be displayed. The target of the project is ease of use and easy maintenance of multitudinous papers under one roof.  The application is coded using C#.NET along with the use of a MySQL Server. It is presented to and approved by the Research &amp; Development Department of my college (BVDUCOEP).
